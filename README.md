## My process
I started making a container and aligning it in the center of the page. Then I tried to match the size off of the provided image(s). I added the html, then centered it. Then I added borders to the image and to the container to make it look nice and round. Then I spaced it all out and I was good to go.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I feel that I didn't learn much from this one. It felt like a lot of the knowledge from the previous assignment I did (Product Cards) is what carried me through this one.

### Continued development

I'd like to focus on understanding flexbox more. Most of my problems seem to be coming from my lack of knowledge on how it works.

### Useful resources

I didn't need to use any resources for this one.
